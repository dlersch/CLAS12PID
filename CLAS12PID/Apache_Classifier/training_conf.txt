#This is the configuration file, used for training a classifier with a given data set
#======================================================================================

#Specifiy directory, folder and name of the training data set:
BASEDIR: /Users/daniellersch/Desktop/CLAS/NN_studies/Apache_Classifier/
DATADIR: /Users/daniellersch/Desktop/CLAS/NN_studies/Apache_Classifier/
TRAININGDATA: sample
NJASONFILES: 4

#Define variables which should be used for the training:
#Variable1: Momentum
#Variable2: NPE_LTCC
#Variable3: NPE_HTCC
#Variable4: Total deposited energy inside the calorimeter
#Variable5: Total deposited energy inside the calorimeter divided by momentum
#Variable6: Time from FTOF
#Variable7: Classification output (should not be used)
#Variable8: Deposited energy in inner part of EC
#Variable9: Deposited energy in outer part of EC
#Variable10: Sum of deposited energy in EC
#Variable11: Deposited energy in PCAL
VARS: variable1, variable2, variable3, variable8, variable9

#Define classifier type and how many iterations to perform:
CLASSIFIER: GBT
NITERATIONS: 100

#Set the percentage, which will be used for training and testing:
#e.g. percentage: 30 means that 30% of the input data set will be used for training
#and the remaining 70% are used for testing
PERCENTAGE: 50

#Name of the file where the classifier will be stored:
CLASSINAME: GBT_V8

#The following lines are only valid for neural network classifier:
ARCHITECTURE: 6: 2
