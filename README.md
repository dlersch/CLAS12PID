# CLAS12PID Codes:

Date: 10/23/2017

Basic codes, that allow to read in .hipo-files, create data-sets (json-files at this stage) and train or use
different classifiers. The following classifiers are implemented:

i) Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
ii) MultilayerPerceptron (aka Neural network)
iii) SVM
iv) kMeans-Clustering

The classifier outputs are translated to continuous probability distributions, which allow for a detailed inspection of the ROC-curve.
